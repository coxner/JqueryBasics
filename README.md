# Jquery Basics

## The Basics
The first step of jQuery is to select the element that you want manipulate..```jQuery $(".red-box") ``` where .red-box is a CSS selector. 
The next step is to attach a jQuery function to your selector. In this example we use the .fadeOut function it looks like this 
```$(".red-box").fadeTo(1000, 0.5);``` the 1000 represents the number of milliseconds it will take for the red-box to fade to 50% opacity.
